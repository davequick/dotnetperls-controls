This is a companion source code project to my website **[Dot Net Perls](http://dotnetperls.com/)**, which is dedicated to sharing code and knowledge primarily about .NET. The code files here includes algorithms, objects, programs, and functions for C#. Some examples are

  * Memory Watcher (as featured in the Firefox 3 article)
  * An easy and fast anagram class for C#
  * A directed acyclic word graph in C#
  * **Single-instance** Windows app class in C# .NET
  * [NGEN.exe](http://dotnetperls.com/Content/Ngen-Installer-Class.aspx) C# class to optimize startup times
  * Useful C# segment code for CSV files
  * Command-line **Scrabble** program written in Perl
  * Multiple **bitcount** algorithms in C# and C++
  * Stopwords removing code for C# strings
  * **Custom dialog** code that has many advantages over message box
  * De Bruijn sequence code that finds the first set bit in a number

The code is explained on the companion website. The code is designed to be highly reusable in your projects, and is coded to my highest standards. It is **now LGPL** so you can use it in commercial products.

Finally, there are two projects that are archived here that are also located at MSDN code. The A`*` pathfinding code is at the second MSDN code link. The ANAGRAM code and the PATHFINDING code are the most fun to use and examine.
